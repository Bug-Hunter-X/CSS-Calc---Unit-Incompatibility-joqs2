The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be unexpected results if the calculation involves units that are not compatible.  For instance, adding `px` and `em` directly might lead to parsing errors.

```css
/* Incorrect calculation */
width: 100px + 2em; 
```

This can be solved by ensuring consistent units within the calculation.
